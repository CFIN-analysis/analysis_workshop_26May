# CFIN ANALYSIS WORKSHOP - May 26th 2025

In this Github repo you find all the Slides and Jupyter Notebooks that will be used for our Analysis Workshop. 
The notebooks are named in sequential order, according to program of the workshop. 

The Workshop takes place at CFIN South, Aarhus, on Monday 26th May 2025. 
The workshop takes the form of focused modules with conceptual introduction first and hands-on session (self-paced) right after. 
The hands-on session consists of one or more Jupyter notebooks provided before-hand, that the participants can explore at their own pace, or use as a basis for their own analysis.
